HOW TO INSTALL THE CORGI ENGINE?
-----------------------------------

To import the asset, follow these steps :

1. Create a new project from Unity Hub, pick the latest stable version of Unity as your Unity version, and 2D or 3D as the Template
2. Go to the Asset Store window and import the project (it has to be in an empty project, not an existing one)
3. You will be warned that importing the Corgi Engine will overwrite your current project settings (that's normal), click on Import.
4. This will take a bit of time.
5. Once this is complete, you'll get a prompt saying "This Unity Package has Package Manager dependencies". This is also normal, click on "Install/Upgrade".
6. After that you'll get a list of the contents of the engine, don't touch anything, and click on Import in the bottom right corner.
7. Import will also take a while. Once import is complete, you're ready to use the engine. Have fun!

And that's all there is to it!
Have fun with the engine!

ALSO IMPORTANT :
----------------

- If you're running a recently released update of Unity, there's a chance you'll get errors on install. 
Don't panic, there's a big chance these are package related. Look at the errors, they may mention a package.
Open the package manager, select said package, and click update in the bottom right corner.
The packages the engine dependson are Cinemachine, PostProcessing and Pixel Perfect.
